This is where your description should go. Limit it to a paragraph or two. Consider adding a small example.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require centrex/laravel-addresses
```

You can run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="addresses-config"
```

## Usage

First, add our `HasAddresses` trait to your model.
        
```php
<?php namespace App\Models;

use Lecturize\Addresses\Traits\HasAddresses;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasAddresses;

    // ...
}
?>
```

##### Add an Address to a Model
```php
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->addAddress([
    'street'     => '123 Example Drive',
    'city'       => 'Vienna',
    'post_code'  => '1110',
    'country'    => 'AT', // ISO-3166-2 or ISO-3166-3 country code
    'is_primary' => true, // optional flag
]);
```

Alternativly you could do...

```php
$address = [
    'street'     => '123 Example Drive',
    'city'       => 'Vienna',
    'post_code'  => '1110',
    'country'    => 'AT', // ISO-3166-2 or ISO-3166-3 country code
    'is_primary' => true, // optional flag
];
$post->addAddress($address);
```

Available attributes are `street`, `street_extra`, `city`, `post_code`, `state`, `country`, `state`, `notes` (for internal use). You can also use custom flags like `is_primary`, `is_billing` & `is_shipping`. Optionally you could also pass `lng` and `lat`, in case you deactivated the included geocoding functionality and want to add them yourself.

##### Check if Model has Addresses
```php
if ($post->hasAddresses()) {
    // Do something
}
```

##### Get all Addresses for a Model
```php
$addresses = $post->addresses()->get();
```

##### Get primary/billing/shipping Addresses
```php
$address = $post->getPrimaryAddress();
$address = $post->getBillingAddress();
$address = $post->getShippingAddress();
```

##### Update an Address for a Model
```php
$address = $post->addresses()->first(); // fetch the address

$post->updateAddress($address, $new_attributes);
```

##### Delete an Address from a Model
```php
$address = $post->addresses()->first(); // fetch the address

$post->deleteAddress($address); // delete by passing it as argument
```

##### Delete all Addresses from a Model
```php
$post->flushAddresses();
```
